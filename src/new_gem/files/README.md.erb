## Development

Do it once — authorize on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) and then:

```shell
gem signin
```

Before release — apply suggestions from RuboCop, review them and commit or reject:

```shell
bin/rubocop --autofix
```

Build `*.gem` file:

```shell
bin/build
```

Try your gem locally, then commit changes in local repository.

Push gem file to rubygems registry and then send new version to remote repository:

```shell
bin/release
```
