# sessions

Configuration for gem [multi-sessions](https://github.com/crosspath/multi-sessions). It supports
cookie-based & JWT-based authorization, but does not support native Rails sessions.

This script updates configuration for RSpec & RSwag if their gems are presented in `Gemfile.lock`.

No special actions required from other developers or PCs.
